# Tasty Bytes – End-to-End Analytics with Snowflake & Power BI

This project takes the **Tasty Bytes** food-truck dataset from Snowflake Marketplace and turns it into an end-to-end analytics solution:

- Data profiling and exploration in Snowflake  
- Building **dynamic tables** for dimensions and fact tables  
- Designing a **star schema** and exposing it to Power BI  
- Creating interactive dashboards for revenue, orders, and city-level performance  

It’s the kind of work I’d do as a data analyst or analytics engineer: understand the business, model the data properly, and then tell the story with visuals.

## Quick Overview

- **Role:** Data Analyst / Analytics Engineer  
- **Stack:** Snowflake, Dynamic Tables, SQL, Power BI  
- **Grain:** Order line and aggregated orders (DT_FACT_ORDER_DETAIL, DT_FACT_ORDER_HEADER, DT_FACT_ORDER_AGG)  
- **Dimensions:** Customer, Truck, Location, Date, Time, Franchise, Menu Item

## Architecture

This is the high-level flow from raw marketplace data to analytics:

1. Raw marketplace tables (FRANCHISE, TRUCK, LOCATION, MENU, CUSTOMER_LOYALTY, ORDER_HEADER, ORDER_DETAIL).  
2. Dynamic tables to build dimensions:  
   - `DT_DIM_CUSTOMER`, `DT_DIM_TRUCK`, `DT_DIM_LOCATION`, `DT_DIM_FRANCHISE`, `DT_DIM_MENU_ITEM`, `DT_DIM_DATE`, `DT_DIM_TIME`  
3. Dynamic fact tables:  
   - `DT_FACT_ORDER_DETAIL`, `DT_FACT_ORDER_HEADER`, and the aggregated fact `DT_FACT_ORDER_AGG`  
4. Power BI connects to the **PowerBI schema** and uses the star schema for reports.

## Data Model

Here’s the analytical model exposed to Power BI:

![Star schema](assets/diagrams/powerbi_star_schema.jpg)

At the centre is `DT_FACT_ORDER_AGG`, surrounded by:

- **dim_date**
- **dim_time**
- **dim_customer**
- **dim_truck**
- **dim_location**
- **dim_franchise**

Each dimension is cleaned and conformed so that analysts can slice measures by city, region, truck, franchise, time, and customer segments.

## Snowflake & SQL Work

All modelling is done in Snowflake using SQL and dynamic tables.

Key pieces:

- Marketplace data ingestion  
- Data profiling queries  
- Star schema creation (dimensions + facts)  
- Data-governance layer (access patterns, schemas, and roles)

## Dashboards & Insights

This Power BI **Order Summary** dashboard sits on top of the `DT_FACT_ORDER_AGG` fact table and the conformed dimensions.

![Order Summary Dashboard](assets/screenshots/powerbi_dashboard.jpg)

From this visual you can quickly see:

- How **sales distribution** shifts across global regions (APAC, EMEA, North America)
- The **top cities** and how much they contribute to total order volume
- Which **brands** dominate revenue and how they compare side-by-side
- Weekly demand patterns, showing which **days of the week** have the highest activity
- Clear **hour-of-day peaks**, highlighting lunch and evening rush periods
- Whether demand is spread across time or concentrated in specific peak windows
